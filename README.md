# GO SLAE Solver

Solves systems of liner algebric equations using one of the three methods: Gaussian, Iterative and Siedelian.

## Prerequisites

Go 1.20+

## Usage

`go run main.go (1|2|3|4) (G|I|S)`

The first argument stands for the example SLAE (1 - 2-dimensional, 2 - 3-dimensional, etc...)

The second argument stands for the method of solving the chosen SLAE (G - Gaussian, I - Iterative, S - Seidelian)

## Room for improvement

- Add a feature to send user's own SLAE
